# Graduate School Project Portfolio
### Overview
This repository contains a curated selection of projects that I have completed as part of my graduate studies. Each project listed below showcases specific skills and theoretical applications in various domains of data science and artificial intelligence. These projects demonstrate my ability to apply complex concepts to solve real-world problems and to develop predictive models that are both robust and scalable.

## Projects
### 1. Heart Disease Mortality Rate Analysis
Course: Probability and Statistics
AAI-500 is an introductory course focused on probability, statistics, and Python programming, aimed at providing students with the foundational skills necessary for advanced AI studies. It covers a range of topics including random variables, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and logistic regression, alongside practical Python applications. The course integrates case studies and real-world problem-solving, culminating in a team project that enhances students' skills in collaboration, presentation, and academic writing.

Tools Used: Python, Jupyter, Statistical Analysis Methods

#### Overview:
This project involved statistical analysis and probability theory to understand the factors influencing heart disease mortality rates. Through rigorous data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the application of statistical tests, I developed a comprehensive understanding of the significant predictors of heart disease. This project emphasized the practical application of biostatistics in public health.

### 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/emlKCF9z5Bo?t=47">**Predictive Classification Modeling of Real Estate Pricing Tiers**</a>
Course: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
AAI-501 provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on modern advancements in machine learning, deep learning, big data, and computational power. It covers essential AI concepts, techniques, and challenges across multiple domains such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and more. Students will learn and apply a variety of AI methodologies, including heuristic search, genetic algorithms, Bayesian networks, and neural network models. Practical applications will be explored in areas like image processing, biomedical systems, and robotics, using Python. The course also emphasizes ethical considerations in AI development, such as fairness, trust, bias, and safety, aiming to foster skills in project management, teamwork, and leadership.

Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Jupyter, Tensorflow, and Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Overview:
In this project, I implemented several machine learning models to classify real estate properties into different pricing tiers based on a variety of features such as location, size, and condition. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and extensive evaluation of classifiers including, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting Machines and more. The final model was deployed to provide real-time predictions that can assist investors and buyers in making informed decisions.
