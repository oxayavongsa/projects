## Analyzing Heart Disease Mortality Rates Among US Adults 35yrs+:<br><br>
**Exploring Gender Disparities, Geographic Correlations, Racial Influences, 
and Environmental Factors.**<br>
<br>The CDC's analysis reveals heart disease as the leading cause of mortality in the U.S., accounting for one-fifth of all deaths in 2021, surpassing other causes like cancer and COVID-19. The comprehensive definition of heart disease encompasses various cardiovascular conditions including acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and strokes. A dataset from 2014, focusing on Americans aged 35 and older across U.S. counties, employs age-adjusted mortality rates to facilitate comparisons across populations with different age structures. By averaging data over three years, it aims to provide a stable view of heart disease mortality, incorporating demographic details and geographical coordinates for nuanced analysis. This study seeks to explore how demographic and geographical factors influence heart disease risk and outcomes, aiming to inform public health strategies for risk mitigation and improved preventive healthcare.<br><br>

### Project Description<br>
The dataset used is titled "Heart Disease Mortality Data Among US Adults (35+) by State/Territory and County". <br><br>
**Datasource:** National Vital Statistics System. Three year average, age-standarized, spatially smoothed county rates that can be displayed by gender and race/ethnicity. <br><br>
After cleaning our dataset we have about 13650 rows & 5 columns. <br><br>
### Data dictionary:  
* Column 1: State<br>
* Column 2: County<br>
* Column 3: Heart Disease Mortality Rate per 100k<br>
* Column 4: Gender<br>
* Column 5: Ethnicity<br><br>
### Questions:<br>
* Are there differences in heart disease mortality rates and gender?<br>
* Are there correlations between geographical locations and heart disease mortality rate?<br>
* Is there a correlation between race and heart disease mortality rates?<br>
* Are their environmental factors, for example, climate or pollution, that correlate with heart disease mortality rates?<br>
* What specific data analysis, visualization, and modeling work are you using to solve the problem? <br><br>
### What roadblocks and challenges during this project include:<br>
* Data cleaning and preprocessing<br>
* Handling missing values<br>
* Choosing appropriate statistical analysis methods<br>
* Choosing the appropriate model or visualization<br>
* Identifying meaningful patterns in the data<br><br>
