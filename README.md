<a href="https://github.com/oxayavongsa/projects/tree/Heart-Disease-Mortality-Rate---Probability-%26-Statistics">**GitHub project**</a><br>
Course: Probability and Statistics
AAI-500 is an introductory course focused on probability, statistics, and Python programming, aimed at providing students with the foundational skills necessary for advanced AI studies. It covers a range of topics including random variables, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and logistic regression, alongside practical Python applications. The course integrates case studies and real-world problem-solving, culminating in a team project that enhances students' skills in collaboration, presentation, and academic writing.

Tools Used: Python, Jupyter, Statistical Analysis Methods

#### Overview:
This project involved statistical analysis and probability theory to understand the factors influencing heart disease mortality rates. Through rigorous data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the application of statistical tests, I developed a comprehensive understanding of the significant predictors of heart disease. This project emphasized the practical application of biostatistics in public health.

### 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/emlKCF9z5Bo">**Predictive Classification Modeling of Real Estate Pricing Tiers**</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/oxayavongsa/projects/tree/Real-Estate-Pricing-Tier---Intro-to-AI>**GitHub project**</a><br>
Course: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
AAI-501 provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on modern advancements in machine learning, deep learning, big data, and computational power. It covers essential AI concepts, techniques, and challenges across multiple domains such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and more. Students will learn and apply a variety of AI methodologies, including heuristic search, genetic algorithms, Bayesian networks, and neural network models. Practical applications will be explored in areas like image processing, biomedical systems, and robotics, using Python. The course also emphasizes ethical considerations in AI development, such as fairness, trust, bias, and safety, aiming to foster skills in project management, teamwork, and leadership.

Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Jupyter, Tensorflow, and Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Overview:
In this project, I implemented several machine learning models to classify real estate properties into different pricing tiers based on a variety of features such as location, size, and condition. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and extensive evaluation of classifiers including, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting Machines and more. The final model was deployed to provide real-time predictions that can assist investors and buyers in making informed decisions.

### 3. <a href="https://github.com/oxayavongsa/projects/tree/U.S-Life-Expectancy-Prediction---Male-vs-Female">Prediction of Life Expectancy Based on Gender</a>

This project aimed to predict life expectancy across different US states for males and females using advanced machine learning techniques. It involved an in-depth analysis of life expectancy data from 2010-2015 and 2020, examining the impact of gender and geographic location on life expectancy rates.

Tools Used: Python, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, GridSearchCV

#### Overview:
In this project, I loaded and inspected datasets containing life expectancy data by state and census tract for the years 2010-2015 and state-level data by sex for the year 2020. The data was thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. I performed exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and distributions within the data. For the predictive modeling, I used Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest model's performance. The project included functions to predict life expectancy for different genders across states, identifying the states with the highest life expectancy for males and females. This project demonstrated my proficiency in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and the application of machine learning models to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.

### 4. <a href="https://github.com/oxayavongsa/projects/tree/Predicting-Stroke-Risk-for-Early-Detection">Predicting Stroke Risk: A Machine Learning Approach to Early Detection and Prevention</a>
Course: Machine Learning for Health

Tools Used: Python, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Decision Tree, Random Forest

#### Overview:
The objective of this project was to predict stroke occurrences using the "healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv" dataset. Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and early prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes. We developed predictive models using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to identify individuals at high risk of stroke based on various health and demographic features. The project involved handling data imbalance using SMOTE and evaluating the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

#### Results:
Random Forest Classifier: Higher accuracy (92%) and reasonable ROC AUC score (0.77)
Decision Tree Classifier: Lower accuracy (71%) and ROC AUC score (0.77)
Feature Importance: Age, BMI, and average glucose level are the top three significant features.
