# AAI-501 Final Project: Real Estate Pricing Tier Classification

Welcome to our AAI-501 Intro to Artificial Intelligence project. We're delving into the complexities of real estate pricing, aiming to make this intricate market more accessible to buyers, sellers, and enthusiasts alike. Our journey uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks to sift through a Real Estate dataset, exploring various classification algorithms to predict pricing tiers accurately.

## <span style="color:green;">**Project Overview**</span>

The real estate market is a tapestry woven from various factors — location, property features, economic conditions, and more. Our mission? To unravel this complexity by creating a model that classifies properties into distinct pricing tiers. This tool is designed to empower decision-making, offering insights that pave the way for a deeper market understanding.

Utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebooks allows us to efficiently process and model data, exploring algorithms from Logistic Regression to Gradient Boosting. Our goal is to illuminate patterns within the real estate realm, making the market's intricacies navigable for all.

Our data is sourced from this Kaggle dataset, offering a comprehensive view of the current real estate landscape.

### **Classification Criteria for Residential Properties:**

* Starter Homes (Tier 1): Affordable options priced below $300,000, ideal for first-time homebuyers or those on a budget. These properties provide entry-level opportunities in various regions or suburban areas.

* Family-Friendly Homes (Tier 2): Mid-range properties priced between $300,001 and $500,000, offering ample space and amenities suitable for families. This tier includes single-family homes, townhouses, or condos with multiple bedrooms and family-oriented features.

* Executive Properties (Tier 3): Upscale living options priced between $500,001 and $1,000,000, featuring modern amenities and convenient access to urban facilities. Executive homes in desirable neighborhoods, upscale condos, or luxury townhouses cater to discerning buyers seeking premium features.

* Luxury Estates (Tier 4): High-end properties priced above $1,000,000, offering expansive living spaces, premium finishes, and exclusive locations. Luxury estates provide affluent buyers with amenities such as swimming pools, private gyms, and meticulously landscaped grounds.

<i>These pricing tiers help categorize residential properties based on their price range and features, providing valuable insights for buyers and sellers in the real estate market.These tiers, shaped by market dynamics and detailed analysis, form the backbone of our model, ensuring relevance and adaptability in our market predictions.</i>

## **Technologies Used**

This project is implemented using the following technologies:
* Python: Our cornerstone for data manipulation and analysis.
* Jupyter Notebook: For interactive modeling and visualization.
* Classification Algorithms: Including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and more, to finely tune our predictions.
* Powerpoint: Recording our presentation.

## **Getting Started**

To embark on this exploratory journey with us:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your device (official Python website).
2. Install Jupyter Notebook via terminal or command prompt with pip install notebook.
3. Clone our project repository to your machine.
4. Navigate to the project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook by executing Jupyter Notebook.
5. Open the .ipynb files to dive into our analysis and models.

## **Algorithms to Investigate**

We plan to explore multiple classification algorithms, including:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Deep Learning Neural Networks**
- **Gradient Boosting**

### **Problem Statement**

**Pricing Tier Classification:** Create a classification model to categorize housing listings into pricing tiers based on features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, living space size, and location. The goal is to classify properties into different price ranges, enabling buyers and sellers to identify suitable options within their budget constraints and market expectations. 

### **System Intention**

The project involves:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Defining pricing tiers
- Encoding categorical values
- Feature selection and dataset splitting
- Model selection, training, and evaluation
- Integration, deployment, and monitoring of models

### **Focus Areas**

- **Data Quality and Preparation**: Handling missing values, outliers, and imbalanced classes.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying and engineering relevant features.
- **Model Complexity**: Balancing complexity with performance to avoid overfitting.
- **Computational Resources**: Ensuring efficient training and evaluation.
- **Ethical and Fairness Considerations**: Ensuring the model's fairness and transparency.

### **Expected Behaviors and Problem Handling**

We aim to provide a reliable classification of real estate into pricing tiers using advanced algorithms like random forests, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and gradient boosting, ensuring accuracy through rigorous data preprocessing and model evaluation.
