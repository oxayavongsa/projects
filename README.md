Course: Intro to AI

Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Jupyter, Tensorflow, and Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Overview:
In this project, I implemented several machine learning models to classify real estate properties into different pricing tiers based on a variety of features such as location, size, and condition. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and extensive evaluation of classifiers including, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting Machines and more. The final model was deployed to provide real-time predictions that can assist investors and buyers in making informed decisions.

### 3. <a href="https://github.com/oxayavongsa/projects/tree/U.S-Life-Expectancy-Prediction---Male-vs-Female">Prediction of Life Expectancy Based on Gender</a>

Tools Used: Python, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, GridSearchCV

#### Overview:
This project aimed to predict life expectancy across different US states for males and females using advanced machine learning techniques. It involved an in-depth analysis of life expectancy data from 2010-2015 and 2020, examining the impact of gender and geographic location on life expectancy rates. I performed exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

### 4. <a href="https://github.com/oxayavongsa/projects/tree/Predicting-Stroke-Risk-for-Early-Detection">Predicting Stroke Risk: A Machine Learning Approach to Early Detection and Prevention</a>

Tools Used: Python, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Decision Tree, Random Forest

#### Overview:
The objective of this project was to predict stroke occurrences using the "healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv" dataset. We developed predictive models using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to identify individuals at high risk of stroke based on various health and demographic features. The project involved handling data imbalance using SMOTE and evaluating the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

### 5. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TztlKFz5VXU">**Predictive Classification Modeling of Real Estate Pricing Tiers**</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/oxayavongsa/projects/tree/Vehicle-Insurance-Fraud-Detection---Machine-Learning">**GitHub Project**</a><br>

Course: Machine Learning

Tools Used: Python, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost

#### Overview:
This project aimed to tackle the issue of vehicle insurance fraud, which causes significant financial losses for insurance companies and erodes consumer trust. By leveraging historical vehicle and policy data, our objective was to develop a robust predictive model to accurately detect and prevent fraudulent claims. The implementation of this model helps insurance companies minimize financial losses, enhance the efficiency of claims processing, and maintain fair premium pricing for customers.
